# Vinyl Vault

Browse your personal **Discogs collection** on any device — grouped by artist, sorted the way you want, searchable, filterable, and available offline. It's an installable web app that runs entirely in your browser: fetch your collection once and it's yours.

## What it can do

- **Your collection, beautifully browsed** — the collection is fetched from the Discogs API and shown as a cover-art grid grouped by artist. Split/collaboration releases are cross-listed under every credited artist (compilations stay under **Various**), and Discogs' disambiguation suffixes are stripped, so **Alice Cooper (2)** groups and searches under **Alice Cooper**.
- **Filing sort** — leading articles (`a`, `an`, `the`) are ignored when sorting, so **The Menzingers** files under **M**. Diacritics and punctuation are normalized too (`Motörhead` → `motorhead`).
- **Sort within an artist** — toggle between **Year** (oldest → newest, default) and **A–Z** per artist; click any artist header to collapse or expand its shelf.
- **Summary & unique albums** — running totals of `N artists · M releases · U unique albums`, and every artist header shows its own counts. *Unique albums* counts distinct masters (a release id when a master is missing), so several pressings of the same album count once.
- **Search & filter** — debounced search across artist, title, genre, style, label and year; filters for format, genre, style, label and year range, all populated from your actual data.
- **Collection folders** — a folder bar above the search: pick a Discogs folder (or **All**) and the search, filters, summary and grids all follow it. The whole collection is fetched once, so switching folders is instant.
- **Release details** — click any cover for an overlay with everything we have: original/pressing years, format, label + catno, genres/styles, credits, country, rating, added date and direct Discogs links.
- **Tracklists** — the detail view also lists the full tracklisting, loaded per release on demand and cached in the browser, so it's instant on reopening and works offline.
- **Random picker** — can't decide what to listen to? A floating shuffle button picks from the current folder (respecting any active search/filters); with a release open, it re-rolls to a new random pick.
- **4 UI styles** — **Midnight** (dark navy), **Paper** (warm light), **Club** (neon dark) or **Forest** (mossy dark) in settings; your choice is remembered.
- **Instant & offline** — pages are fetched from Discogs at a pace that stays inside their rate limit, then cached in the browser: later visits show the collection instantly and refresh it quietly in the background. Add the app to your home screen and use it like a native app.

## What you need

- A free **Discogs personal access token** — create one at <https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers>.
- That's it. There's no account, no server and nothing to install — the app runs entirely in your browser and your data stays there (see [Where your data lives](#where-your-data-lives)).

## How it works

1. **Set up** — enter your Discogs username and personal access token once.
2. **Fetch** — the app pulls your collection from the Discogs API, paged and paced to stay well inside their 60 requests/minute limit, retrying automatically if the API asks us to slow down.
3. **Browse instantly** — the collection is saved in your browser, so it opens instantly next time — even offline — and quietly re-checks Discogs in the background for changes.
4. **Dive deeper** — original release years are enriched in the background from each album's Discogs master record, streaming in as results arrive, so you gradually see original-year and pressing-year where they differ.
5. **Details on demand** — opening a release shows everything on hand; the full tracklist is fetched per release and cached after first view.

> **For the technical reader:** all API calls go through a same-origin `/discogs` proxy (the vite dev server, and nginx in the Docker image). Discogs rate-limit responses carry no CORS headers, so without that proxy the browser would mask throttling as an opaque CORS error instead of a retryable response.

## Where your data lives

- Your **token stays in your browser** (localStorage). It's sent to Discogs and nowhere else. Anyone with access to your device could extract it — regenerate it anytime at <https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers>.
- The **collection, tracklists and cached years live in your browser** (IndexedDB). Nothing is stored on a server — the deployment is completely stateless.
- **"Clear everything"** in settings removes the cached collection and stored credentials from your device.

## Deployment (production)

The app is a static frontend; the published container bundles it with nginx. Every push to `main` builds a multi-arch image for **amd64 and arm64** and publishes one tag: `ghcr.io/ackervekenbm/vinyl-vault:latest`.

**Pull and run** on any machine with Docker (arm64 runs natively on a Raspberry Pi):

```yaml
services:
  vinyl-vault:
    image: ghcr.io/ackervekenbm/vinyl-vault:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**Or build from source:**

```bash
docker compose up --build    # serves on http://localhost:8080
```

Notes for self-hosting:

- The container is **stateless** — all user data lives in the browser, so updates and redeploys are lossless (`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`).
- The nginx image **proxies `/discogs` → `api.discogs.com`**. If you serve the static files some other way, you must replicate that proxy or API calls will run into Discogs' CORS/rate-limit wall (see the note under *How it works*).
- **Offline launch needs HTTPS.** Over plain HTTP, iOS adds the app to the home screen fine (it honors the legacy `apple-*` meta tags) and the app runs as long as the server is up — but the service worker that allows launching with the server down only registers in a secure context, and the certificate must be one the device trusts. From least to most setup:

  | Approach | What's needed | Notes |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | **mkcert — your own local CA** | Install your CA profile once on each device | Fully self-hosted and offline; no external party involved |
  | **Domain + Let's Encrypt** (DuckDNS + Caddy/nginx) | A free domain and a TLS reverse proxy; use the **DNS-01** challenge so no ports need to be opened | Public CA, so devices trust it with zero setup |
  | **Tailscale** | Tailscale on the server and your devices | Free, auto-renewing Let's Encrypt certs on your private tailnet via `tailscale serve` |

## Development

**Tech stack** — React 19 · TypeScript · Vite · idb (IndexedDB) · vite-plugin-pwa (service worker + manifest) · nginx (container host + API proxy).

**Requirements** — Node.js **22+**, plus a Discogs token if you want to test against a real collection.

**Quick start**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5199> (if the port is taken, Vite moves to the next free one and prints the address). The dev server proxies `/discogs` to the Discogs API, just like nginx does in production.

**Scripts**

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Type-check, lint, then production build to `dist/` (also regenerates the PWA service worker + manifest) |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm test` / `npm run test:watch` | Unit tests (vitest + jsdom, @testing-library/react) |
| `npm run lint` / `lint:fix` | ESLint (flat config) |
| `npm run icons` | Regenerate app icons from `public/icons/icon.svg` |

**Verify a change**

```bash
npm run build && npm test
```
